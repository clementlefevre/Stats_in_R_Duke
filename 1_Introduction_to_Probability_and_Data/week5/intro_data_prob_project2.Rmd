## Part 1: Data

The data used for the research has been collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and US States for the year 2013. This study aimed at analysing behavioral risk factors and preventive health practices and the related health condition. There are 330 variables and 491775 subjects in the 2013 data file. Thoses variables contains informations related to :

- demographics and social context,

- health care access,

- behavioral features (e.g. tobacco use, physical activity),

- current health condition, 

- pathology screening.


#### Cases
The cases are non-institutionalized adults residing in the US.

#### Sampling methodology

Interviews are either via landline of cell phone.
For landline calls, a stratified sampling process has been used for the selection of the number : 1 stratum for high density numbers; an other for medium density.
On top of this sampling technique, the landlines calls have sampled with one randomly selected adult ofr for each household.

For cell calls, a simple random sampling based on the phone number, for person receiving  90% or more of the calls per cell phone.

#### Scope of inference

Since the study does consist in a telephone survey on randomly selected adults and no treatments is randomly assigned to the subjects, we can considere it as an **observational study**.

Therefore we can conclude on **associations** but not on causality between the explanatory variables (behavior and practices) and the response (health condition).

From those points we can infer that the results observed in this study can be **generalizable** on the non-institutionalized adults residing in the US, but not causality can be drawn.
